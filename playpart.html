<span style="color: red;">_[in the doorway]_.</span> <br>I found a note from you at home. What does this
mean?
<br><br>
<b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
<br>
<br>
<b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
<br>
<br>
<b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
are at the dance upstairs.
<br>
<br>
<b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
<span style="color: red;">[coming into the room]_.</span><br>Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
<br>
<br>
<b>MRS LINDE.</b><br>
Yes, why not?
<br>
<br>
<b>KROGSTAD.</b><br>
Certainlyâ€”why not?
